# MedTime — Game Design Notes (updated)

Goal
Make Edexcel "Medicine Through Time" engaging through a progressive, narrative-driven PWA that can be installed on iOS and Android via Safari.

New additions in this version
- Gore toggle: Players choose whether historical realism (blood/dissection imagery) is shown. This respects sensitivity while letting the game feel more authentic for those who want it.
- Dissection/Barber-surgeon scenes: flagged per-map; when gore is enabled a tasteful overlay and context text appear to give atmosphere, not to sensationalize.
- Accessibility: clear toggle and warning; content is non-graphic, and the gore visuals are purely atmospheric.

Core systems
- Maps = chronological units (Ancient → Modern). Map N+1 unlocks only after N is completed.
- Roster = playable/hireable historical archetypes with simple stats and levels.
- Challenges = short multiple-choice quizzes with immediate feedback and XP; could be extended with timeline puzzles, source analysis, or drag-and-drop.
- Progression = XP and player levels; roster levels increase occasionally when leveling up.

Pedagogy
- Each challenge includes an explanation after answering to reinforce learning.
- Keep sessions short for revision-friendly gameplay.

Content hygiene & sensitivity
- Scenes that historically involved blood (dissections, battlefield surgery, barber-surgeons) are represented with restrained visual cues and neutral, educational language.
- Toggle is provided so teachers/students can disable any blood-related visuals.

Expansion ideas
- Timeline mini-game (drag events to correct dates).
- Source-evaluation mini-challenges: short excerpts from historical texts and 2–3 MCQs on provenance/bias.
- Multiplayer classroom quizzes (teacher hosts, students join).
